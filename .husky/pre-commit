### since lint-staged covers all the prettier and lint chcking we don't need explicit format check
# yarn run format:check ||
# (
#   echo "❗❗Prettier check failed😥, Run yarn run format, add changes and commit again❗❗"
#   false;
# )

yarn run lint-staged ||
(
  echo '🟥🟥eslint check failed😥, try yarn run lint:fix or fix it manualy, add changes and commit again🟥🟥'
  false;
)
